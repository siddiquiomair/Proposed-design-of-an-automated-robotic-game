# Proposed-design-of-an-automated-robotic-game
Proposed design of an autonomous robotic system for playing a static turn-taking chess game with a human partner<br>
In this application, I proposed a design of an autonomous robotic system for playing a static turn taking chess game with a human partner. There is total 4 steps used to design complete application. First part includes design of robot model using sensors and actuators. Second part consists of computer vision algorithm which analyse chess board as image and identify specific colour for placing next move. Third algorithm is an integration of computer vision algorithm with robot model. Forth step has an algorithm which identifies next move depending on instruction sequence. I used programming language Python to connect actuators and sensors with camera. Python is more efficient and adaptive language.
